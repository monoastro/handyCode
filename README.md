# Arduino Weight Trainer (AWT)

You'll need the following packages
tensorflow
keras
numpy
jupyter notebook
matplotlib

To use:
Setup x_train and y_train in the notebook to be the examples you want the network to train on.
Run the cells sequentially and you'll see your network(hopefully) fit the training data.
The final cell prints out a nicely formatted text version of the trained weights that can be directly copied into the arduino sketch.
